									<p>By joining forces, together we will substantially improve our understanding of this exceptional planktonic biological model and study with much more confidence questions relative to both current and past global change and biodiversity. Through interactive discussions, the community involved in the network will attempt to build an attractive scientific agenda by prioritizing the most urgent scientific questions amongst the few examples listed below.<br>
									We have identified three scientific axes in which the various partners are already active, each highlighting the scientific questions that could be addressed during the operations of this international network.<br><br></p>

									<h2>Scientific axis 1:</h2>
									<h4>Biodiversity and evolutionary patterns in relation to climate and oceanographic changes</h4>
										<li>How can we best unravel the evolutionary patterns and past/present diversity of polycystine radiolarians?</li>
										<li>What are the long-term trends and short-term biotic response in radiolarian bodysize and silicification during climate warming events?</li>
										<li>What is the tempo and mode of morphological change of species through geological time?</li>
										<li>Do morphological shifts occur in relation to climate warming events?</li>

								<section>
									<h2>Scientific axis 2:</h2>
									<h4>Biology, symbiosis, ecology and biogeography</h4>
										<li>How can we best work out the species concept of polyctine radiolarians based on morphological/skeleton and genomic data?</li>
										<li>How can we best evaluate and disentangle variations in skeleton morphology and structure due to genotypic vs. ecophenotypic or ontogenetic variations?</li>
										<li>Who are the main polycystines populations contributing to downward fluxes and subsequent sequestration in surface sediments?</li>

								<section>
									<h2>Scientific axis 3:</h2>
									<h4>Biomineralisation and implication in biogeochemical cycles</h4>
										<li>To what extent are polycystine radiolarians involved in the cycling of elements in the marine environment (e.g. carbon and silicon biogeochemical cycles)?</li>
										<li>Do polycystine radiolarians accurately reflect seawater geochemistry (e.g. silicon stable isotope composition, germanium) and the way this geochemical record varies over the long term and during critical climate warming intervals??</li>

									<p><strong>This initiative will operate with</strong>:
										<li>Regular zoom meetings amongst the official partners and with a wider yearly conference organized in hybrid mode. Each annual conference will attempt to attract a large number of participants, giving priority to Early Stage Researchers MSc and PhD students and post-docs.</li>
										<li>In person visits of Master and PhD students, post-docs and permanent staff amongst the different partner laboratories.</li></p>
									<ul></ul>
										<p>The IRN PRATIO will consolidate and explore further international collaboration on an interdisciplinary, yet targeted, research topic and ultimately produce a substantial number of interdisciplinary and hopefully groundbreaking publications.<br><br></p>
